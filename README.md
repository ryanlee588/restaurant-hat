# Restaurant Hat

A service that helps you pick a random restaurant from submitted choices. It allows users to create lists which allow other users to add restaurants to, and generates a random restaurant from the list when requested.

This web app has been deployed using vercel and can be found [here](https://restaurant-hat.vercel.app).

# Requirements

## Primary Requirements

1. The application has a web page that allows a user to input a restaurant of their choice, which is submitted to a backend service via an API call.
2. The backend service has an API that returns a random restaurant from the submitted choices.
3. Other users may submit restaurants of their choice as well.
4. The web page allows a user to request for a random choice based on the submitted choices. After the random choice is shown, no further restaurants may be submitted.

## Secondary Requirements

1. Only the user who submitted the first restaurant may make the request in primary requirement 4.
2. Multiple users may initiate different sessions and invite guests to submit choices to their session. These choices are limited only to the initiated session.

# Web App Layout
